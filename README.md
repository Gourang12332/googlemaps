I have    paricipated in google's hackathon of 3d photorealistic tiles on google map, where i learnt to access google cloud feaatures , like place api, to navigate to the searched location ,markers, gmp-3d tag and maps javascript api, this has actively and enthusiastically increased my knowledge and skill.
This is small html , js page of maps javascript api, which renders , a 3d model of maps , through google gmp-3d tag, and navigating using place api .

This is what this amazing google api brings to me , it is just awesome, rendering it and applying small effects using its docs has amazed me and everyone should once try this atleast once.
